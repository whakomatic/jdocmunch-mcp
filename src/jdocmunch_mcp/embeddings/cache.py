"""Content-hash-keyed embedding cache (v1.15.0).

Sidecar at ``~/.doc-index/<owner>/<name>.embeddings.jsonl``. One JSON line
per cached vector keyed by section ``content_hash``. The first line is a
header line containing the provider/model identity — provider rotation
purges the cache automatically on next load.

Cache schema:

    Line 0 (header):  {"_header": true, "provider": "...", "model": "...", "dim": 384}
    Line 1+:          {"hash": "<sha256>", "vector": [f, f, ...]}

Why JSONL not SQLite:

- Append-only. Every embed pass adds a few hundred lines; no schema migration.
- Diff-friendly. Reviewers can inspect what changed across releases.
- Simple recovery. Truncated files are still partially usable — corrupt
  lines are skipped on load.

Cache hits short-circuit ``provider.embed_texts`` for unchanged sections,
which dominates the cost on a typical incremental re-index (most sections
unchanged).
