"""Embedding providers for semantic section search.

Supports Gemini (text-embedding-004), OpenAI (text-embedding-3-small),
OpenAI-compatible endpoints, FastEmbed (offline, ONNX) and
sentence-transformers (offline, torch) — neither offline provider needs a key.

Auto-detection priority (first available wins):
    1. JDOCMUNCH_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER env var
       (gemini/openai/openai-compatible/fastembed/sentence-transformers/none)
    2. GOOGLE_API_KEY → Gemini            (opt-in, see below)
    3. OPENAI_API_KEY → OpenAI            (opt-in, see below)
    4. fastembed installed → local offline ONNX model
    5. sentence-transformers installed → local offline torch model

⚠ Steps 2 and 3 are PAID CLOUD providers and are SKIPPED by auto-detect unless
JDOCMUNCH_ALLOW_PAID_EMBEDDINGS is set. A bare key in the environment must not
silently bill, and must not silently send the indexed corpus to a third party.
Naming the provider in step 1 is always honored.

A named provider whose package is not installed resolves to no provider at all,
with a warning. `get_provider_name()` returning a name means embedding can
actually run, which is what its callers assume when they report semantic search
as available.

Set JDOCMUNCH_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=none to disable all embedding.

    the process-wide **loader lock** is held -- has been observed parked in
    `RtlEnterCriticalSection` under `LdrLoadDll`, indefinitely, by a native
    stack taken twice 25 s apart. The Python-visible half is a second thread
    stuck in `threading.Thread.start()`: a new thread needs that same loader
    lock to run its `DLL_THREAD_ATTACH` callbacks, so it never reaches
    `_bootstrap_inner` and `_started` is never set.

    ⚠ **What it is NOT: OpenBLAS's own thread pool.** That was the first
    explanation here, and `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1` was then measured against a
    reproduction that wedged 7 runs in 8 -- it **still wedged**. At one thread
    `blas_thread_init` spawns none, so whatever that `DllMain` waits on, it is
    not threads it created. The remedy is unaffected either way; the sentence
    was not, and a wrong mechanism in a docstring is what the next person
    reasons from.

    ⚠⚠ A failed in-process attempt is not recoverable and is not local. Once a
    thread wedges inside `LdrLoadDll` the loader lock is never released, so
    EVERY later `LoadLibrary` in the process blocks too — a later, unrelated
    caller inherits the hang. There is nothing to interrupt: it is a kernel-mode
    wait, so a timeout, a thread kill, and a try/except are all equally useless.
    The only bounded probe is one that runs somewhere we can abandon.

    ⚠ The check earns its cost independently of the deadlock: a provider whose
    import raises (observed in the wild as
    ``ImportError: cannot import name 'HybridCache' from 'transformers'``, a
    sentence-transformers/transformers version pairing the user did not choose)
    is unusable, and finding that out at the END of a heavyweight import chain
    is strictly worse than finding it out up front.

    Returns the provider name that was warmed, or empty string if nothing
    was warmed (no provider configured, warmup not needed for this provider,
    or warmup failed).

    Only providers with significant first-call latency get warmed.
    sentence-transformers lazy-loads a local model on first embed_query,
    which (a) can hang past the MCP client's tool-call timeout, and
    (b) can write progress chatter to stdout, corrupting MCP JSON-RPC
    framing if it happens after stdio_server takes over.

    Network providers (gemini, openai, openai-compatible) are first-call-fast
    enough that warmup is unnecessary; warming them would add an avoidable
    network round-trip to startup.

    jdoc#110: warmup is SKIPPED when the model is not already in the local
    HuggingFace cache. A cached load costs ~7.6 s; an uncached one downloads
    inside the same window, and a 440 MB model pushed a reporter past the MCP
    client's 30 s connect timeout — the server never registered at all, and the
    error said only "connection timed out", naming neither models nor
    downloads. Deferring an uncached model turns a one-cycle outage into a slow
    first tool call that can report a real error.

    ⚠⚠ Warmup is not merely an optimization and must not be made unconditional
    background work: it exists so the model load happens BEFORE `stdio_server`
    owns stdout. `contextlib.redirect_stdout` is process-global, so a load
    running concurrently with JSON-RPC cannot be redirected safely — chatter
    would corrupt framing for every request. Skipping is safe; backgrounding
    is not.
