    jdocmunch rewrites the whole ``<name>.json`` on every save. Without a
    cross-process lock, two concurrent writers for the same repo (e.g. a
    scheduled reindex and a per-edit hook) interleave their read-modify-write
    and ``os.replace`` then installs a corrupt/partial index, or one writer's
    update is silently dropped (last-replace-wins). This decorator holds an
    exclusive lock for the whole method -- including the ``load_index`` read in
    ``incremental_save`` -- so the read-modify-write is atomic between processes
    on both POSIX (flock) and Windows (msvcrt).

    Non-reentrant (the lock is per-fd), so a decorated method must not call
    another decorated writer for the *same* repo while holding the lock. Today
    neither writer calls the other.

    jdoc#93 QA-23: a decorated method may opt into a ZERO-WAIT acquisition by
    accepting a ``lock_wait`` parameter and being called with
    ``lock_wait=False``. Contention then returns False immediately with
    ``outcome["reason_code"] = "index_lifecycle_busy"`` instead of queueing.
    That is the PUBLIC-path contract: a tool call that silently blocks on a
    lock is indistinguishable from a hang to its caller, so contention is
    reported as a typed, retryable answer. Internal coordinated operations
    (the retirement's own guarded delete) keep the blocking acquisition —
    they are mid-protocol and a bounded wait is correct there.

    Only ``delete_index`` opts in today; the default is unchanged blocking, so
    every other writer behaves exactly as before.

        has already written that sidecar before ``save_index`` runs, so this is a

        pipeline (e.g. an in-process build) would have no sidecar -- stripping
        would then lose the vectors. When the sidecar is absent and sections do
        carry embeddings, persist one here so the strip is always lossless.

        The header identity is a placeholder (``_load_sidecar_vectors`` ignores
        the header); a subsequent real embed pass sees the mismatch and simply
        re-embeds, which is safe.

        an incremental ``index_file`` pass, whose sections were embedded
        outside the cache pipeline, had its vectors stripped by the save and
        never persisted anywhere. It now APPENDS the missing keys instead,
        which never removes a row and never overwrites a real provider header
        with the ``__inline__`` placeholder (doing so would make the next
        embed pass read an identity mismatch and purge the whole file).

        real sidecar. That readmission costs one stat and no parse.

        of a handle joins one lifecycle coordinator). Retirement additionally
        takes the retained handle's gate nonblockingly only inside the final

        ``expected_fingerprints`` (jdoc#88 QA-01) maps ``owner/name`` handles

        :class:`RetirementConflict` with nothing touched), and again

        refresh rebuilds them. An expected value of None always conflicts.
        Omitted (``None``) → the pre-existing unguarded behavior.

        Passing any dict, INCLUDING an empty one, selects the guarded path and
        therefore also requires ``retirement_publication``. An empty proof
        asserting nothing can never authorize a removal, so it conflicts
        rather than silently degrading to an unguarded delete. Callers that
        want the unguarded behavior omit the argument.

        receives ``{"reason_code": ...}`` and, for guarded post-commit record

        retirement concluded the index never existed and re-indexed, which is
        the duplicate-creation failure this arc exists to prevent. Out-param
        rather than a changed return type so every existing caller is
        untouched.

        jdoc#93 QA-23: ``lock_wait=False`` makes contention return False
        immediately rather than wait. The public tool passes False explicitly
        (fast ``index_lifecycle_busy`` refusal); retirement passes True.

        jdoc#95 QA-25 (RESOLVED, was UNRESOLVED): two tests once called
        ``delete_index(owner, name)`` with no lock_wait while requiring
        OPPOSITE behavior on the SAME lock — the target handle's write lock

        * ``test_v1_115_0_qa90.py::test_qa17_retained_delete_refused_inside_final_gate``
          needs an immediate False. A retirement is paused mid-unlink holding
          this handle through ``_gate_retained_handle``, and blocking would
          wait on work that cannot finish.
        * ``test_v1_115_0_lifecycle_v2.py::test_three_processes_keep_one_lock_inode``
          (Linux-only, SKIPS on Windows) needs a block. Contention there is an
          ordinary cross-process writer that will release.

        Neither is wrong, and no default satisfies both. We proposed inferring
        intent from surrounding state (refuse when a pending retirement record
        names this handle as retained, else honor lock_wait). The reviewer, who
        authored both tests, rejected that in favour of the simpler rule:
        **every contention-sensitive caller states whether it waits or
        refuses, and the lock never deduces it.** Both tests now pass the flag
        explicitly, so this default arbitrates nothing.

        ⚠ The default stays False, and ``test_v1_115_0_qa25.py`` asserts that
        by signature inspection. It is not a preference: a caller that forgot
        to say gets the refusing behavior, which preserves the QA-17 guarantee
        that both participating indexes are never simultaneously absent — a
        data-loss property. Defaulting to blocking would make forgetting cost
        an index. Do not flip it; add an explicit argument at the call site."""
