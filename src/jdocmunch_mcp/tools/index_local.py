      2. RELOAD both indexes and re-prove the decisive predicates

         was captured BEFORE this reload, any change the re-proof ran on is
         the state the token describes, and any change AFTER the reload is
         caught by the guard in step 4 — the proved state and the accepted
         token can no longer diverge (the QA-06 proof/capture gap).
      3. Publish the durable retiring record and REQUIRE the receipt:
         cleanup never starts without authoritative recovery state on disk
         (QA-07).
      4. Guarded delete: ``delete_index`` re-verifies the exact publication

         completion.

    The shipped report ran the full refresh first, rewriting the legacy index
    whenever source files changed — precisely when the read-only guarantee
    mattered. This resolver proves from STORED snapshots plus live Git
    evidence and never enters a save path.

    stored peer must both be certified clean at one SHA, and the live checkout
    must be clean at that same SHA. Three clean legs at one commit mean the
    stored snapshots describe the live tree, so the stored path-and-hash
    comparison is the same proof apply would reach after its refresh. A
    genuinely uncertified legacy index reports honestly that report cannot

    Args:
        path: Path to local folder.
        name: Optional repo identifier override. Use when two folders share the same
              name (e.g. two libraries both with a 'docs' folder). Defaults to the
              folder name.
        use_ai_summaries: Whether to use AI for section summaries.
        use_embeddings: True/False/"auto". "auto" (default) enables embeddings when
                        an embedding provider is configured (GOOGLE_API_KEY,
                        OPENAI_API_KEY, openai-compatible
                        + JDOCMUNCH_OPENAI_COMPAT_URL + JDOCMUNCH_OPENAI_COMPAT_MODEL,
                        or sentence-transformers installed).
        storage_path: Custom storage path (default: ~/.doc-index/).
        extra_ignore_patterns: Additional gitignore-style patterns to exclude.
        follow_symlinks: Whether to follow symlinks.
        incremental: When True and an existing index exists, only re-index changed files.
        max_files: Maximum number of doc files to index. Default 10000.
                   When hit, response includes truncated/discovered/indexed
                   top-level fields (jdoc#15).
        sort_by: "newest" (default) or "walk_order". Controls which subset
                 is indexed when discovered > max_files. "newest" sorts by
                 mtime descending so recently-edited files always make it
                 into the index regardless of filesystem-walk position
                 (jdoc#16). "walk_order" preserves the pre-1.65 behavior
                 for callers needing deterministic reproducible builds.
                 No effect when the corpus fits under the cap.
        paths: Optional list of explicit paths to index. When provided, the tree
            walk is skipped; only these files (and the contents of any directories
            in the list) are indexed. Each entry may be absolute or relative to
            ``path``. Useful for batch-indexing exactly the files an agent already
            knows about — e.g. the doc files git just touched.
            On an existing index with ``incremental=True`` the diff is scoped to
            the listed subset (jdoc#31): listed files are added/updated, a listed
            file that no longer exists on disk is removed, and indexed files NOT
            in the list are left untouched (never treated as deleted).
        worktree_mode: ``"reuse_equivalent"`` (default, jdoc#83) recognizes when
            an equivalent corpus in a linked Git worktree already has an
            established index — a proven-fresh equivalent is reused (returned,
            not refreshed) instead of creating a duplicate; stale, dirty,
            ambiguous, or evidence-incomplete outcomes return a bounded
            decision with no write. ``"branch_local"`` opts out: intentionally
            create or refresh an exact-path index for THIS worktree.
        legacy_reconcile: jdoc#87 (Part C.2). ``"report"`` proves whether the
            explicitly named pre-1.102 fieldless legacy index is an exact
            duplicate of its single modern peer (same verified identity, same
            clean certified commit, full path-and-hash coverage) WITHOUT
            changing anything; ``"apply"`` repeats the proof immediately
            before retiring the selected legacy handle (the only possible
            loser — the peer is never touched). Requires an explicit
            ``name=`` selecting a handle that is fieldless at call start, a
            full refresh (no ``paths``), default ``worktree_mode``, and
            confirmed Git lineage; anything else fails closed with
            ``legacy_reconcile_not_applicable`` and no write. Omitted
            (default): an ordinary refresh stays backfill-only and never
            retires anything.
