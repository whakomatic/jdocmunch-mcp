"""The sdist exclude list is proven by BUILDING, not by grepping pyproject.toml.

Ported from jcodemunch-mcp after jcm 1.108.305 shipped `relnotes.md` -- a
scratch copy of release notes -- inside a published sdist, swept up by a
`git add -A` in the release commit. The allowlist below found a second
instance (`suite.log`) minutes later.

⚠⚠ This repo had NEITHER half of that guard, which is the standing "a setting
fixed in one repo of a suite is fixed in one repo" lesson. A defect reportable
in one of three servers is a parity gap until proven otherwise.

⚠ `tests/` is shipped inside this sdist (200 members), so anything dropped
there is distributed too -- see CLAUDE.md on `tests/infographic.png`, a 5.9 MB
promotional image that was 87% of the whole source distribution until 1.123.2.
That one was a TRACKED file, so exclusion rules and untracked-file scans were
both blind to it; `test_no_oversized_member_ships` is the check that would have
seen it.

⚠ `uv.lock` is gitignored here (unlike jcm), so it is never distributed. It is
deliberately absent from ALLOWED_ROOT_FILES; the staleness test would fail if
someone copied jcm's list wholesale.

Failure here means: fix `[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist] exclude` in
pyproject.toml, or delete the stray file. Do not fix it by deleting the canary.
